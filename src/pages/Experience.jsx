            My work at Workmedia has been full of new experiences. In the first
            couple of months, all I did was to get every piece of information
            and organize it in order to improve my own work – and, therefore, my
            performance: new spreadsheets, moving a ton of data from Google
            Drive to Notion, and collecting crucial information that no one
            thought could be useful before. For me, it was pretty easy, because
            I ace WordPress and I have really strong organization Skills – I
            understand the value of it, especially when it makes my life easier.

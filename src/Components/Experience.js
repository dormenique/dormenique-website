      <p>
        My work at Workmedia has been full of new experiences. In the first
        couple of months, all I did was to get every piece of information and
        organize it in order to improve my own work – and, therefore, my
        performance: new spreadsheets, moving a ton of data from Google Drive to
        Notion, and collecting crucial information that no one thought could be
        useful before. For me, it was pretty easy, because I ace WordPress and I
        have really strong organization Skills – I understand the value of it,
        especially when it makes my life easier.

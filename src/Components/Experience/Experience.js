      <p>Workmedia [Projectista] Feb 2021 – nowadays – Lisbon, Portugal</p>
      <p>
        My work at Workmedia has been full of new experiences. In the first
        couple of months, all I did was to get every piece of information and
        organize it in order to improve my own work – and, therefore, my
        performance: new spreadsheets, moving a ton of data from Google Drive to
        Notion, and collecting crucial information that no one thought could be
        useful before. For me, it was pretty easy, because I ace WordPress and I
        have really strong organization Skills – I understand the value of it,
        especially when it makes my life easier. I also started to learn more
        code with my coworkers and I had been very helpful as a Junior Front-End
        Developer, working mostly with CSS, JavaScript, API, and building
        websites as a web designer on Figma. For some time I even manage to work
        as a Quality Assurance Tester from the websites that have been updated.

      <h4>Hand Lettering Teacher</h4>
      <p>Dormenique – Jan 2016 – Dec 2019 – São Paulo, Brazil</p>
      <p>
        I created Dormenique as a brand – a way to represent my work that, back
        then, was all done by myself. As an artist and designer, I’ve been using
        Instagram and other social media to promote my work and let people know
        what I do. I used to teach people how to draw letters (hand lettering) –
        from kids to old people. My work has already been recognized by
        Papelaria Universitária, SESC, Casa das Letras, Pixel Show. I’ve been
        producing, planning, managing, and teaching. Everything that I did for
        my company, I did alone – and this brought me high management and
        organization skills.

      <h4>Illustrator</h4>
      <p>Opala Rosa Choque – Nov 2015 – Dec 2017 – São Paulo, Brazil</p>
      <p>
        Opala Rosa Choque is an illustration studio that focuses on publicity.
        My job there was to help the other illustrators on most projects – I
        learned many things about how the company worked and how was the whole
        process of approval (from the sketch to the deadlines). We used to work
        with softwares like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, but sometimes we
        did handmade stuff as well.
